<h1 align="center">‚ûï Svelte Adders</h1>

## ‚ùì What is this?
This is a community project of commands to add particular functionality to Svelte projects.

They are all *composable*, meaning that it should always be possible to run one after running any other command without something breaking (ideally). This should put an end to the boilerplate problem: too much or too little is included.

## üß∞ SvelteKit
[SvelteKit is an alpha project now](https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-the-deal-with-sveltekit), but work is starting now so that there are good integrations for when it enters beta.

* [**svelte-add/bulma**](https://github.com/svelte-add/bulma): Add Bulma to your SvelteKit project

* [**svelte-add/firebase-hosting**](https://github.com/svelte-add/firebase-hosting): Add hosting on Firebase to your SvelteKit project

* [**svelte-add/graphql**](https://github.com/svelte-add/graphql): Add a GraphQL server to your SvelteKit project

* [**svelte-add/mdsvex**](https://github.com/svelte-add/mdsvex): Add mdsvex to your SvelteKit project

* [**svelte-add/postcss**](https://github.com/svelte-add/postcss): Add PostCSS to your SvelteKit project

* [**svelte-add/tailwindcss**](https://github.com/svelte-add/tailwindcss): Add Tailwind CSS to your SvelteKit project

### üí° Example
To migrate from [`sapper-firebase-typescript-graphql-tailwindcss-actions-template`](https://github.com/babichjacob/sapper-firebase-typescript-graphql-tailwindcss-actions-template) to SvelteKit, these commands can be run to recreate all the functionality:

```sh
# Use the official SvelteKit template
npm init svelte@next  # Say yes to TypeScript preprocessing and select plain CSS

npx svelte-add postcss
npx svelte-add tailwindcss

npx svelte-add graphql

npx svelte-add firebase-hosting
# Actually, there's a limitation for right now that server functions like a GraphQL server
# aren't supported by svelte-add/firebase-hosting, but that could be solved later!
```

So, to exclude a feature you weren't using that was still included in the boilerplate anyway, *don't* run its corresponding command. Suppose you only wanted PostCSS and to host on Firebase, then drop the `tailwindcss` and `graphql` additions.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Vite
Some Svelte Adders also work for Svelte projects using Vite without SvelteKit:

* [**svelte-add/mdsvex**](https://github.com/svelte-add/mdsvex): Add mdsvex to your Vite-powered Svelte app

* [**svelte-add/postcss**](https://github.com/svelte-add/postcss): Add PostCSS to your Vite-powered Svelte app

* [**svelte-add/tailwindcss**](https://github.com/svelte-add/postcss): Add Tailwind CSS to your Vite-powered Svelte app

## üóë Excluding examples
To demonstrate how the functionality they add works, most adders include examples you might not need if you're already familiar with the tool involved. You can give the `--exclude-examples` option to the adder command to keep things minimal:

```sh
npx svelte-add mdsvex --exclude-examples
```

Or you can delete the extra files after the fact.

## üéÅ Contributing
This is a community project! Here are some ways you can help:
* Battle test (combinations of) adders to make sure they're always composable and find other edge cases, bugs, etc.
* Fix known issues and missing features in an adder per the open issues on its repository.
* Read [this repository's open issues](https://github.com/svelte-add/svelte-adders/issues) to talk about ideas for new adders.
* If you're ready to make a new adder, try using an existing adder's repository as a template [and change it up to make it add the functionality you want](https://usepreset.dev/).
* Create a [pull request](https://github.com/svelte-add/svelte-adders/pulls) to add your project to this list.
